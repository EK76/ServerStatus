# Server Status
Purpose for this project is to monitor the temperature of computer's CPU and harddisk when using a Linux operatingsystem. In my case it is Ubuntu 25.04 LTS.
You can also vheck when the Linux computer have been last rebooted. But you can also use any kind of the most common Linux distributions for this purpose.
