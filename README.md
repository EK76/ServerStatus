# Server Status
Purpose for this project is to monitor the temperature of computer's CPU and harddisk when using a Linux operatingsystem. In my case it is Ubuntu 25.04 LTS.
You can also vheck when the Linux computer have been last rebooted. But you can also use any kind of the most common Linux distributions for this purpose.


After creation of database and tables are done.
Edit configdb.txt file with the correct info about your MySQL credentials with text editor of your choosing.
Compaile or publish the project with Visual Studio 2022 to test it.
